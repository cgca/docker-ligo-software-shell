# ligo/software-shell

This container is intended for use as a lightweight virtual machine that
replicates a LIGO software environment on all operating systems. It includes
a default user (albert) and command-line environment.

It is intended to be a "terminal" image that other containers should not build
from. `ligo/software` is the correct container to use in tools like GitLab CI
and Travis CI and should be used to construct derivative containers.

## Running on MacOS
The following command will ensure that user home directories are mounted in
such a way that the albert user has the same level of access as your account.
```
docker run -it --privileged --restart=unless-stopped -v Users:/Users -v cvmfs:/var/lib/cvmfs ligo/software-shell:jessie
```
